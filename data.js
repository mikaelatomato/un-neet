            `<p>Welcome to the "UN-NEET", a kind of blog, kind of journal 
            where I will share my fight against my lazy, conformist and always guilty self, aiming to 
            become a web developer and an independent person.
            </p>
            
            <p>I will be honest, this is not the first time I have tried to change for the better,
            and every previous time it has ended in me just accomplishing a little work, and then quitting
            for the next weeks or months, and it has been this way for a couple of years now. I am not
            just a NEET, I am an "Elite NEET", I have chosen this kind of life for myself thinking that I would
            be able to change at any moment, and that the change would be easy, that achieving what I wanted in life
            would be something that would naturally happen without a lot of effort or trouble.
            </p>

            <p>But as you can tell, I was completely wrong. After you have lived long enough in the same way, day after day,
            you start to develop habits, behaviours, thoughts and a specific mindset that are very hard to quit.
            I have become an expert at watching the days pass by doing absolutely nothing. I can be bored out of my mind,
            and I will still not feel the desire to do anything to change my situation. Why? because it feels comfortable,
            because studying, working, being disciplined is painful, tiring and the rewards that come from that feel like a distant dream.
            </p>
